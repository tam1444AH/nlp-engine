Make sure you have a valid version of Python installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install all neccessary packages by using "pip install {package_name}", like for example you are in a valid Python enviroment, and you see a yellow squiggly line under pandas.
You would do "pip install pandas". Do this for all packages you see this for.
